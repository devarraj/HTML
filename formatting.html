    <h2>rajkumar text</h2>
    <p> <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500<sup>s</sup>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <b>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged</b>. <del>It was popularised in the 1960<sub>s</sub> with the release of Letraset sheets</del> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently <mark>with desktop publishing software like Aldus</mark> <ins>PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</ins> </p>
